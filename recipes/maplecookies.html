<p><h2>#1 Maple Cookie</h2></p>
<p>These have been voted the number one cookie that I bake (and I bake a lot!), and are loved by all who eat them. They are chewy mapley good!</p>
<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons Ground Cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Margarine, Softened</li>
        <li>1 Cup White Sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Real Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup White Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Maple Sugar</li>
     </ul>
</p>
<p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 cup of white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and maple syrup.</li>
        <li>Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until just mixed. In a small dish, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup white sugar and the maple sugar.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be crackly on top and look wet in the middle. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
    </ol>
